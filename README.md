### Project overview
---

---- **Delivrables**

   - Create a data model for analysis
   - A dashboard in which we see the distribution per gender , race , age , age group distribution, gender distibution per department , age distibution per gender , termination disbtribution per department
   - A chart regarding the evolution of employees nunmber




  

 ### Data sources
 ---

*Company  Data  on  Human resource operations,the dataset use for this analysis is "Human Resources.csv"  file . we have data on birthdate , department ,hire_date , location_state ........*

### Tools
---

  - Excel-power query : ETL
  - SQL : Data cleaning
  - MYSQL : Transformation and loading
  - Power BI : Data model and visuaization
 

### Data cleaning 
---

- From the excel we see that , the data type are text and date
- The birthday , hire_date and termdate  variables are dates but have different format , so we have to  make sure that there all have the same format
- We have termdate which are in the future, which is not normal

-- Creating the database
```
create database if not exists human_resource ;
```

-- selecting the database to be use
```
use human_resource ;
```

-- modifying the column name from  Ã¯Â»Â¿id to emp_ID
```
alter table hr
change column Ã¯Â»Â¿id emp_ID varchar(20) null;
```

-- Checking the data information (fields . datatype, key, null, default , extra) 
```
describe hr ;
```

-- Remove the update restrictions
```
set sql_safe_updates = 0;
```

--As soon as you  have finish with all your updates , you have to set it back to 1 , to secure back your database (is a security feature that is protecting your database)
```
set sql_safe_updates = 1;
```

-- Harmonizing the birthdate column  by Formatting 
```
update hr

when birthdate like '%/%' then  date_format(str_to_date( birthdate, '%m/%d/%Y'), '%Y-%m-%d')
when birthdate like '%-%' then  date_format(str_to_date( birthdate, '%m-%d-%Y'), '%Y-%m-%d')
Else Null
end ;

-- Modify the datatype of  birthdate column from text to date
```
alter table hr

-- Harmonizing the hire_date column  by Formatting 
```

Else Null
end ;
```

-- Modify the datatype of hire_date column from text to date
```
alter table hr

-- Harmonizing and formatting the values of the termdate column from datetime to date
```

where termdate is not null and termdate != '' ;
```

-- Modify the datatype of termdate column from text to date
```
alter table hr
modify column termdate date ;
```

-- Adding a column (age) in the table for analysis purpose
```
alter table  hr
add column age int ;
```

-- calculating the age of employees
```

### Exploratory data analysis
---

EDA involved exploring  the sales data to  answer key question , such as :

  - What is the male to female distribution ?
  - what is the race distribution ?
  - what is the  age to gender distribution ?
  - what is the  gender to department distribution ?

	
### Findings
---

-- There are more men than wowen in the company
-- The number of employee is increasing with time
-- The dorminate race in the company are white
